A surge in at-home baking, driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, caused a significant spike in demand. According to market research, the increased interest in culinary experiences and DIY baking led to a higher adoption rate of essential kitchen tools, including pastry brushes.</p><ul> <li><strong>Surge in Home Baking:</strong> As more people turned to baking as a hobby or necessity, pastry brushes became a staple tool in many households.</li> <li><strong>Material Preferences:</strong> Silicone and natural bristle brushes gained popularity for their ease of use and ability to handle different doughs and glazes.</li> <li><strong>Rise of Online Retail:</strong> E-commerce platforms provided a convenient way for consumers to purchase specialized baking tools, boosting sales.</li></ul><h2>Shifting Trends and Forecast: 2023-2033</h2><p>The pastry brush market is poised for further expansion as trends like sustainable kitchenware, advanced materials, and continued popularity of home cooking influence consumer preferences.</p><ul> <li><strong>Eco-Friendly Materials:</strong> Sustainability is expected to be a major driving force in the next decade.

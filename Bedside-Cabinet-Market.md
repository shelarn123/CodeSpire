Brands will also enhance their digital presence through augmented reality (AR) tools to allow customers to visualize furniture in their space.</li> <li><strong>Rise in Rental and Temporary Housing:</strong> With the increase in short-term rental housing and relocations, there will be a growing demand for portable and modular furniture options. Bedside cabinets that are easy to assemble and disassemble will gain popularity in this context.</li></ul><p>In summary, while the market for bedside cabinets showed moderate growth from 2018 to 2022, the next decade promises even more exciting developments.
